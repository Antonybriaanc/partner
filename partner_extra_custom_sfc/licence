GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                   Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General
Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share
and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains
free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation,
use the term "copyleft" to refer to this general method of
licensing software. 

This license, the Lesser GNU General Public License, applies to
certain designated libraries, and is intended to allow developers
to use the libraries in their own software under certain conditions.
It is a more permissive license than the ordinary GNU General Public
License, allowing the use of the library in proprietary programs
under certain conditions, but still preserving the essential freedoms
of free software for the library itself.

                           TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. This License applies to any software library or other program
that is licensed under this License. The "Library", below, refers
to the library or the work that is licensed under this License.
An "object code" form of a Library means any form of a Library
that is not source code.

1. You may use the Library for any purpose, and you may distribute
copies of the Library or of modified versions of it under the
terms of this License.

2. You must cause the modified Library to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the Library and the date of any change.

3. You may distribute the Library only if you include a copy of
this License along with it. You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.

4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Library
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Library
is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
License.

5. You may not use the name of the Free Software Foundation or
the name of any other organization or individual to endorse or
promote products derived from this software without specific
prior written permission.

6. This License is intended to be a compromise between the
freedom of the user and the protection of the authors' interests.
You may choose to use the Library without modifying it, but
if you modify it and distribute it, the modified version must
be licensed under the same terms as the original.

7. This License does not grant you any rights to use the name
of the Library or its contributors, except as allowed under
this License.

8. The authors of the Library provide it "as is" and without
any warranty of any kind, express or implied, including, but
not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and
fitness for a particular purpose.

9. If any provision of this License is found to be unenforceable
or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the
minimum extent necessary so that the License shall remain in full
force and effect.

10. This License shall be governed by the laws of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, United States of America.

11. This License may be changed by the Free Software Foundation
by republishing it in a revised form. You may obtain a copy of
the latest version from <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html>.
